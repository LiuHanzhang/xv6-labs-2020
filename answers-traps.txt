1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
$a0-$a7; $a2 contains 13

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
No call to f. See call.asm line 46
   26:	45b1                	li	a1,12
the compiler directly store the f(8)+1 in a1 as immediate number.

3. At what address is the function printf located?
0x648

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0x38

5. Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);

What is the output?

He110 World

If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? 
Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

i = 0x726c6400; No

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

Output uncertain, y would be random number
